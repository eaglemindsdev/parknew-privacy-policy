         </h1>
         <p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 40px;padding-right: 40px;">These Legal Terms and any policies or
                  operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
                  agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
                  provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal
                  Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                  obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay,
                  or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
                  provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
                  part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and
                  enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or
                  agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the
                  Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                  drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these
                  Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
